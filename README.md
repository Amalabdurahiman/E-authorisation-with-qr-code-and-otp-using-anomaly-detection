E-Authorization Using QR Code and OTP with Anomaly Detection

This project aimed to develop a secure e-Authorization system integrating QR codes and OTPs for multi-factor authentication, enhanced with machine learning-based anomaly detection. The goal was to improve authentication security by leveraging Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM models to detect fraudulent login attempts.

Project Objectives:

ðŸ”¹ Implement QR-based authentication and OTP verification for secure login.
ðŸ”¹ Integrate machine learning models to identify anomalous authentication attempts.
ðŸ”¹ Address dataset imbalance using SMOTE to improve anomaly detection performance.
ðŸ”¹ Evaluate models using KDDCup99, KDDTest+, and UNSW-NB15 datasets.
ðŸ”¹ Compare traditional authentication security with the proposed MFA + anomaly detection approach.

Project Status:

Unfortunately, I was unable to fully complete the project due to time constraints, data limitations, and implementation issues. However, the work done so far provides a strong foundation for future improvements, and I plan to revisit and enhance it as I continue to develop my skills in cybersecurity and machine learning.

This repository serves as a reference for the research and development conducted, and I welcome any contributions or feedback from the community! ðŸš€
